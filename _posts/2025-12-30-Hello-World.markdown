Hello World! Welcome to The Half Sheet. As we wrap up 2025 and stumble into 2026, I find myself interested in having a place not connected to a large corporation, but more accessible to the masses than Mastadon, to put the occasional thought, project update, or reflection on life. My hope is to expand this over time with automatic posting to both my Mastadon (thejuggler@hackaday.social) and my Instagram (@jugglinggeek). We will see how that goes, and if I stay consistent here at all. More to come.

Below we have a picture of Blåhaj, the trans-iconic IKEA shark plush! This is primarily to test adding images to this blog.
